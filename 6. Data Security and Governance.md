# 🔐 **Data Security and Governance – Theory**

Data Security & Governance ensures that **machine learning initiatives protect sensitive data, comply with legal regulations, and minimize risk to the organization.**
This is crucial especially in industries like **finance, healthcare, and insurance**, where customer data is extremely sensitive.

### **1️⃣ Data Privacy and Data Security**

**Data Privacy** → focuses on **how personal data is collected, processed, stored, and shared** according to laws and user consent.

**Data Security** → focuses on **protecting data from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches**.

Important principles:

| Privacy               | Security                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Why data is collected | Encryption                  |
| Who has access        | Role-based access           |
| Consent               | Secure API communication    |
| Data minimization     | Network firewalls, VPC, IAM |

Real techniques used in MLOps:

* Encryption **in transit (TLS/HTTPS)** and **at rest (AES-256)**
* Masking / Tokenization for PII fields (name, phone number, bank details)
* Access logging & audit trails
* Zero-trust security models

### **2️⃣ Data Access Management**

Not every engineer should access every dataset.

Control using:

| Method                 | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| IAM Roles              | Restrict access based on responsibility |
| RBAC                   | Project-wise or team-wise data access   |
| Attribute-based access | Time/location/department-based access   |
| Secrets Management     | Store credentials securely              |

Tools:

* AWS IAM / GCP IAM / Azure AD
* Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager

Golden rule:
⚠️ **Never store access keys inside code, GitHub, or Docker images**

---

### **3️⃣ Data Retention**

Data Retention defines **how long data should be stored and when it should be deleted**.

Why retention matters:

* To comply with laws & customer policies
* Reduce storage cost
* Prevent misuse of old data

Typical retention approaches:

* Raw data → stored short duration
* Feature engineered data → stored longer
* Aggregated and anonymized data → stored longest

Retention policy depends on:

| Industry   | Typical Duration |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Healthcare | 6–10 years       |
| Banking    | 7 years          |
| E-commerce | 1–5 years        |

---

### **4️⃣ Need of Compliance & GDPR**

Organizations must follow compliance laws to **protect customer identity and avoid legal penalties**.

**GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation (EU)**
Rules:

* Collect minimum data needed
* Inform users how data will be used
* Allow users to delete/export their data (`Right to be Forgotten`)
* Report any data breach within **72 hours**

Impacts on MLOps:

* Personal data should be anonymized before ML training
* ML monitoring systems cannot expose identity-linked logs

---

### **5️⃣ HIPAA Compliance**

Applies to **Healthcare data in the United States**.

Regulates:

* Medical history
* Diagnosis & prescriptions
* Lab reports
* Insurance health data

Key requirements for ML workflows:

* Data encryption at every stage
* Secure patient identity masking before ML training
* Strict access controls for sensitive datasets
* Audit logs for every data access

---

### **6️⃣ PCI Compliance**

Applies to **payment card & banking data**.

Covers:

* Credit/Debit card numbers
* CVV
* Bank account details
* Transaction logs

PCI DSS rules:

* No storing raw CVV ever
* PAN (card number) must be encrypted/masked
* Redaction required in logs and datasets
* Payment systems must undergo periodic security testing

---

### **7️⃣ Compliance Consequences & Penalties**

If companies **ignore compliance**, consequences can be extremely costly.

| Violation Type | Risk                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| GDPR           | Millions of euros in fines                  |
| HIPAA          | Criminal charges + business shutdown        |
| PCI DSS        | Heavy fines + blocking payment facilitation |
| Data breach    | Loss of customer trust + lawsuits           |

Example headlines in real world:

* Hospitals fined for exposing patient reports
* Banks penalized for storing unencrypted transaction logs
* E-commerce companies sued for selling user analytics without consent

---

### **8️⃣ Compliance Summary**

| Topic           | Purpose                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Data Privacy    | Responsible usage of data              |
| Data Security   | Protect system from cyber threats      |
| Data Governance | Rules for accessing and managing data  |
| Compliance      | Legal requirement to protect user data |

Core message:

> **MLOps is not just about model accuracy — models must be legal, ethical, and compliant.**
