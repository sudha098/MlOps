### **MLOps**

**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of **practices, tools, and processes** that automate and streamline the **end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning models**, including **data preparation, model development, training, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement**.

It combines concepts from:
🔹 **Machine Learning (ML)**
🔹 **DevOps (CI/CD + automation)**
🔹 **Data Engineering**

The goal of MLOps is to ensure that **ML models can be reliably built, deployed, monitored, and maintained in production at scale**.

### **Key Pillars of MLOps**

| Stage      | What it focuses on                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data       | Collection, validation, versioning                               |
| Model      | Training, hyperparameter tuning, experiment tracking, versioning |
| Deployment | Serving models via APIs, batch jobs, or streaming                |
| Monitoring | Model performance, data drift, inference metrics                 |
| Governance | Security, compliance, reproducibility, auditability              |

### **Why MLOps Is Needed**

Without MLOps ⛔
Models get built but never reach production, or degrade after deployment with no monitoring.

With MLOps ✔️
Models are deployed **reliably, repeatedly, and safely**, similar to how software releases are managed.

### **In One Line**

> **MLOps makes ML models production-ready and ensures they work correctly throughout their lifecycle — not just in Jupyter notebooks.**
