## 📌 **Model Development and Training – Theory**

### **1️⃣ Model Development**

Model Development is the stage where **data scientists select an algorithm and build a machine learning model** using the prepared dataset.
Key activities:

* Understanding the business problem (classification/regression/recommendation etc.)
* Selecting the right ML algorithm (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, etc.)
* Splitting the dataset into **training**, **validation**, and **testing** sets
* Feature engineering (creating new features from available data to improve model performance)

⚠️ Output of this stage → a **first working (baseline) ML model**.

### **2️⃣ Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**

Once a model is selected, it must be **trained on historical data** so it can learn patterns.

Examples of training processes:

* Gradient descent optimization
* Backpropagation for neural networks

To improve performance, we adjust **hyperparameters** (settings that control the learning process):

* Learning rate
* Number of layers / trees
* Batch size
* Maximum depth
* Dropout rate
* Epochs

⚙️ Common tuning methods:

| Method                | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Grid Search           | Tests every combination of parameters           |
| Random Search         | Picks parameters randomly for faster results    |
| Bayesian Optimization | Learns from previous runs to select best values |
| Hyperband / ASHA      | Efficient for large models like deep learning   |

🔁 Goal → **Find the best hyperparameters to maximize model accuracy while avoiding overfitting.**

### **3️⃣ World of CPUs and GPUs**

ML training needs compute resources.

| Resource           | Best For                                  | Pros                             | Cons                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **CPU**            | Small–medium ML models                    | Cheap, available in all machines | Slow for deep learning |
| **GPU**            | Deep learning, image/video/NLP            | Massive parallel processing      | Expensive              |
| **TPU** (optional) | Large-scale deep learning on Google Cloud | Fast for tensor ops              | Vendor locked          |

💡 MLOps pipeline should support **auto-scaling** compute for training workloads.

### **4️⃣ Introduction to MLflow**

**MLflow** is a tool for managing the complete ML lifecycle.
It mainly solves four key problems:

| Feature         | Purpose                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MLflow Tracking | Logs parameters, metrics & artifacts from experiments                        |
| MLflow Projects | Reproducible packaging of ML code                                            |
| MLflow Models   | Standard packaging of trained models                                         |
| MLflow Registry | Central registry for **model versioning & lifecycle (Staging → Production)** |

Why MLflow?

* Helps in tracking and comparing all experiment runs
* Enables team collaboration and reproducibility
* Supports deployment to many platforms (AWS Sagemaker, Kubernetes, Databricks, etc.)

---

### **5️⃣ Demo: Setting up MLflow (Concept Overview)**

Typical setup includes:

* Python environment with `mlflow` installed
* MLflow Tracking Server
* Backend DB (MySQL/Postgres) for metadata
* Artifact store (S3 / GCS / Azure Blob / Local filesystem)

Flow of demo:

1. Install MLflow
2. Start MLflow Tracking UI
3. Configure backend + artifact storage
4. Connect your training script to MLflow

---

### **6️⃣ Demo: Running an Experiment & Storing Results**

During training, MLflow auto-logs:

* Model parameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
* Evaluation metrics (accuracy, MSE, F1-score, etc.)
* Plots (loss curves)
* Model artifacts (pickle, ONNX, h5, tokenizer, etc.)

Result:
Every experiment has a unique **Run ID**, and you can visually compare runs to pick the best model.

---

### **7️⃣ Demo: MLflow Model Artifact & Versioning**

After selecting the best experiment run:

* Register the model in **MLflow Model Registry**
* Assign stage:

  * **Staging → Production → Archived**
* Supports CI/CD integration for ML model deployment

Example lifecycle:

```
Data Scientist trains model → Registers in MLflow → Reviewer approves → 
CI/CD deploys to production → Monitoring → Retrain if performance drops
```
